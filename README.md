# Digital-stopwatch-using-logic-gates
Using the Logisim Evolution software, this project implemented a digital stopwatch by using logic gates and flip flops to create multiple subcircuits such as counters, registers, stack, encoders, multiplexers, etc which are used in the main circuit.

## Directions
For running this project on your own device you will need to download Logisim Evolution software (version 3.8.0 to be specific), which can be found from here: https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases . Then you can load one of the stages in the software to play around with it yourself. For an introduction to Logisim software, refer to this link https://www.baillifard.com/logisim/en/html/guide/index.html
